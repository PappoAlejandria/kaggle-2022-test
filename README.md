# Testing C++ using Kaggle's 2022 Christmas problem

With this project I intend to learn C++ seriously by tackling a pretty challenging problem posed in https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2022. I will implement the simulated annealing heuristic algorithm to find a (hopefully) satisfactory enough solution while focusing on the overall structure and efficiency of my code.
